cs/9809089v1,"Performance Analysis of FDDI Token Ring Networks: Effect of Parameters
  and Guidelines for Setting TTRT","the performance of fiber-distributed data interface (fddi) depends upon several workload parameters; for example; the arrival pattern, frame size, and configuration parameters, such as the number of stations on the ring, extent of the ring, and number of stations that are waiting to transmit. in addition, the performance is affected by a parameter called the target token rotation time (ttrt), which can be controlled by the network manager. we considered the effect of ttrt on various performance metrics for different ring configurations and concluded that a ttrt value of 8 ms provides a good performance over a wide range of configurations and workloads.",R.

cs/9809114v1,The descriptive complexity approach to LOGCFL,"building upon the known generalized-quantifier-based first-order characterization of logcfl, we lay the groundwork for a deeper investigation. specifically, we examine subclasses of logcfl arising from varying the arity and nesting of groupoidal quantifiers. our work extends the elaborate theory relating monoidal quantifiers to nc1 and its subclasses. in the absence of the bit predicate, we resolve the main issues: we show in particular that no single outermost unary groupoidal quantifier with fo can capture all the context-free languages, and we obtain the surprising result that a variant of greibach's ``hardest context-free language'' is logcfl-complete under quantifier-free bit-free projections. we then prove that fo with unary groupoidal quantifiers is strictly more expressive with the bit predicate than without. considering a particular groupoidal quantifier, we prove that first-order logic with majority of pairs is strictly more expressive than first-order with majority of individuals. as a technical tool of independent interest, we define the notion of an aperiodic nondeterministic finite automaton and prove that fo translations are precisely the mappings computed by single-valued aperiodic nondeterministic finite transducers.",Clemens Lautemann,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809114v1,1998-09-28T07:57:32Z,1998-09-28T07:57:32Z,cs.CC,"['cs.CC', 'F.1.3']",1998,cs,CC
cs/9811016v1,Comparing a statistical and a rule-based tagger for German,"in this paper we present the results of comparing a statistical tagger for german based on decision trees and a rule-based brill-tagger for german. we used the same training corpus (and therefore the same tag-set) to train both taggers. we then applied the taggers to the same test corpus and compared their respective behavior and in particular their error rates. both taggers perform similarly with an error rate of around 5%. from the detailed error analysis it can be seen that the rule-based tagger has more problems with unknown words than the statistical tagger. but the results are opposite for tokens that are many-ways ambiguous. if the unknown words are fed into the taggers with the help of an external lexicon (such as the gertwol system) the error rate of the rule-based tagger drops to 4.7%, and the respective rate of the statistical taggers drops to around 3.7%. combining the taggers by using the output of one tagger to help the other did not lead to any further improvement.",Martin Volk,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9811016v1,1998-11-11T11:06:34Z,1998-11-11T11:06:34Z,cs.CL,"['cs.CL', 'I.2.7']",1998,cs,CL

cs/9811027v1,Push vs. Pull in Web-Based Network Management,"in this paper, we show how web technologies can be used effectively to (i) address some of the deficiencies of traditional ip network management platforms, and (ii) render these expensive platforms redundant. we build on the concept of embedded management application, proposed by wellens and auerbach, and present two models of network management application designs that rely on web technologies. first, the pull model is based on the request/response paradigm. it is typically used to perform data polling. several commercial management platforms already use web technologies that rely on this model to provide for ad hoc management; we demonstrate how to extend this to regular management. second, the push model is a novel approach which relies on the publish/subscribe/distribute paradigm. it is better suited to regular management than the pull model, and allows administrators to conserve network bandwidth as well as cpu time on the management station. it can be seen as a generalization of the paradigm commonly used for notification delivery. finally, we introduce the concept of the collapsed network management platform, where these two models coexist.",J.

cs/9809026v1,Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars,"language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of the form pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). stochastic grammars, on the other hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. a language model of the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix probability sum_{w in sigma*} pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. the main result in this paper is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic tree adjoining grammar (tag). the algorithm achieves the required computation in o(n^6) time. the probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to achieve termination. this algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation techniques for stochastic tags to be used for language modelling.",Mark-Jan Nederhof,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809026v1,1998-09-18T03:45:45Z,1998-09-18T03:45:45Z,cs.CL,"['cs.CL', 'I.2.7; D.3.1']",1998,cs,CL

cs/9811028v1,TCP Trunking,"a tcp trunk is an ip tunnel under tcp control, capable of carrying packets from any number of user flows. by exploiting properties of tcp, a tcp trunk provides elastic and reliable transmission over a network, and automatically shares the network fairly with other competing trunks. moreover, by aggregating user flows into a single trunk flow, tcp trunking can significantly reduce the number of flows that the network needs to manage, thereby allowing use of simplified management to achieve improved perfor mance. for example, when dealing with only a small number of tcp trunk flows, a router with a simple fifo buffer can experience low packet loss rates.   a tcp trunk is a ""soft"" circuit in the sense that it requires no flow states to be maintained inside the network. setting up a tcp trunk involves only configuring the two end nodes. this is in contrast with traditional methods of configuring circuits via signaling of network nodes.   a simple packet-dropping mechanism based on packet accounting at the transmitter of a tcp trunk assures that, when the trunk reduces its bandwidth in response to network congestion, user tcp flows carried by the trunk will reduce their bandwidths by the same proportion. simu lation results have demonstrated that tcp trunks can provide improved network performance to users, while achieving high network utilization.",H.

  Layer, Part I: Concepts, Goals and Methodology","congestion is said to occur in the network when the resource demands exceed the capacity and packets are lost due to too much queuing in the network. during congestion, the network throughput may drop to zero and the path delay may become very high. a congestion control scheme helps the network to recover from the congestion state. a congestion avoidance scheme allows a network to operate in the region of low delay and high throughput. such schemes prevent a network from entering the congested state. congestion avoidance is a prevention mechanism while congestion control is a recovery mechanism. we compare the concept of congestion avoidance with that of flow control and congestion control. a number of possible alternative for congestion avoidance have been identified. from these a few were selected for study. the criteria for selection and goals for these schemes have been described. in particular, we wanted the scheme to be globally efficient, fair, dynamic, convergent, robust, distributed, configuration independent, etc. these goals and the test cases used to verify whether a particular scheme has met the goals have been described. we model the network and the user policies for congestion avoidance as a feedback control system. the key components of a generic congestion avoidance scheme are: congestion detection, congestion feedback, feedback selector, signal filter, decision function, and increase/decrease algorithms. these components have been explained.",R.

cs/9910018v1,Decoupling Control from Data for TCP Congestion Control,"many applications want to use tcp congestion control to regulate the transmission rate of a data packet stream. a natural way to achieve this goal is to transport the data packet stream on a tcp connection. however, because tcp implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet stream directly using a tcp connection forces the data packet stream to be subject to tcp's other properties caused by tcp error control, which may be inappropriate for these applications.   the tcp decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of applying tcp congestion control to a data packet stream without actually transporting the data packet stream on a tcp connection. instead, a tcp connection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up separately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then associated with that of the tcp packets. since the transmission rate of these tcp packets is under tcp congestion control, so is that of the data packet stream. furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a tcp connection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to tcp error control.   because of this flexibility, the tcp decoupling approach opens up many new opportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some existing applications. all of these advantages will be demonstrated in the thesis.   this thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the tcp decoupling approach, and its successful applications in tcp trunking, wireless communication, and multimedia streaming.",S.

  Conversational Speech?","identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog. little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (das) can be automatically classified in truly natural conversation. this study asks whether current approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding prosodic information. the study is based on more than 1000 conversations from the switchboard corpus. das were hand-annotated, and prosodic features (duration, pause, f0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted for each da. in training, decision trees based on these features were inferred; trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance. performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the output of an automatic speech recognizer. for an overall classification task, as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to classification. feature-specific analyses further revealed that although canonical features (such as f0 for questions) were important, less obvious features could compensate if canonical features were removed. finally, in each task, integrating the prosodic model with a da-specific statistical language model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially for the case of recognized words. results suggest that das are redundantly marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.",E.

cs/0110027v1,Part-of-Speech Tagging with Two Sequential Transducers,"we present a method of constructing and using a cascade consisting of a left- and a right-sequential finite-state transducer (fst), t1 and t2, for part-of-speech (pos) disambiguation. compared to an hmm, this fst cascade has the advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of slightly lower accuracy. applications such as information retrieval, where the speed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.   in the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity class c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential fst. every c_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [adj_noun], although it represents a set of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. the sequence of the c_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our fst cascade. it is mapped by t1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i. every r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of alternative tags. intuitively, t1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i, thus creating r_i. finally, t2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to a sequence of single pos tags t_i. intuitively, t2 selects the most likely t_i from every r_i.   the probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not at run time. they do not (directly) occur in the fsts, but are ""implicitly contained"" in their structure.",Andre Kempe,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0110027v1,2001-10-11T11:29:49Z,2001-10-11T11:29:49Z,cs.CL,"['cs.CL', 'F.1.1; I.2.7']",2001,cs,CL

cs/0301006v1,Temporal plannability by variance of the episode length,"optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing the expected episode length. for interacting agents in time-critical applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or the full task is an additional relevant issue. besides, there exist highly stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of time. the identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting markov decision processes. in this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived. the emerging bellman-type equation is a simple extension of sobel's work (1982). methods of dynamic programming as well as methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. computer demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle.",Balint Takacs,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0301006v1,2003-01-09T12:39:03Z,2003-01-09T12:39:03Z,cs.AI,"['cs.AI', 'I.2.8']",2003,cs,AI
cs/0305044v2,Updating beliefs with incomplete observations,"currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. this is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for bayesian networks. recently, grunwald and halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. in this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. we model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. in general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. this is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. we apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. in the special case of bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. this result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with bayesian nets. using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.",Gert de Cooman,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0305044v2,2003-05-27T11:05:52Z,2004-05-17T15:03:28Z,cs.AI,"['cs.AI', 'I.2.3']",2003,cs,AI

cs/0508004v1,A three-valued semantics for logic programmers,"this paper describes a simpler way for programmers to reason about the correctness of their code. the study of semantics of logic programs has shown strong links between the model theoretic semantics (truth and falsity of atoms in the programmer's interpretation of a program), procedural semantics (for example, sld resolution) and fixpoint semantics (which is useful for program analysis and alternative execution mechanisms). most of this work assumes that intended interpretations are two-valued: a ground atom is true (and should succeed according to the procedural semantics) or false (and should not succeed). in reality, intended interpretations are less precise. programmers consider that some atoms ""should not occur"" or are ""ill-typed"" or ""inadmissible"". programmers don't know and don't care whether such atoms succeed. in this paper we propose a three-valued semantics for (essentially) pure prolog programs with (ground) negation as failure which reflects this. the semantics of fitting is similar but only associates the third truth value with non-termination. we provide tools to reason about correctness of programs without the need for unnatural precision or undue restrictions on programming style. as well as theoretical results, we provide a programmer-oriented synopsis. this work has come out of work on declarative debugging, where it has been recognised that inadmissible calls are important. this paper has been accepted to appear in theory and practice of logic programming.",Lee Naish,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0508004v1,2005-08-01T05:23:44Z,2005-08-01T05:23:44Z,cs.LO,"['cs.LO', 'F.3.1; F.3.2']",2005,cs,LO

cs/0510019v2,Entropy based Nearest Neighbor Search in High Dimensions,"in this paper we study the problem of finding the approximate nearest neighbor of a query point in the high dimensional space, focusing on the euclidean space. the earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions (that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash tables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest neighbor in at least one table. our approach is different -- we use one (or a few) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket containing its nearest neighbor. we show that the number of randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of the query point $q$ required depends on the entropy of the hash value $h(p)$ of a random point $p$ at the same distance from $q$ at its nearest neighbor, given $q$ and the locality preserving hash function $h$ chosen randomly from the hash family. precisely, we show that if the entropy $i(h(p)|q,h) = m$ and $g$ is a bound on the probability that two far-off points will hash to the same bucket, then we can find the approximate nearest neighbor in $o(n^\rho)$ time and near linear $\tilde o(n)$ space where $\rho = m/\log(1/g)$. alternatively we can build a data structure of size $\tilde o(n^{1/(1-\rho)})$ to answer queries in $\tilde o(d)$ time. by applying this analysis to the locality preserving hash functions in and adjusting the parameters we show that the $c$ nearest neighbor can be computed in time $\tilde o(n^\rho)$ and near linear space where $\rho \approx 2.06/c$ as $c$ becomes large.",Rina Panigrahy,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0510019v2,2005-10-07T00:55:06Z,2005-11-04T16:55:50Z,cs.DS,['cs.DS'],2005,cs,DS

0802.3106v1,Studies of Polymer Deformation and Recovery in Hot Embossing,"in large area micro hot embossing, the process temperature plays a critical role to both the local fidelity of microstructure formation and global uniformity. the significance of low temperature hot embossing is to improve global flatness of embossed devices. this paper reports on experimental studies of polymer deformation and relaxation in micro embossing when the process temperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (tg). in this investigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to investigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process temperature and load pressure. the depth of indentation was controlled and the load force at a certain indentation depth was measured. experiments were carried out using 1 mm thick pmma films with the process temperature ranging from tg-55 degrees c to tg +20 degrees c. the embossed structures included a single micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. it was found that at temperature of tg-55 degrees c, elastic deformation dominated the formation of microstructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. from tg-20 degrees c to tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and permanent cavities could be formed on pmma substrates without obvious relaxation. however, the formation of protrusive structures as micro pillars was not complete since there was little polymer flow. with an increase in process temperature, microstructure could be formed under lower loading pressure. considering the fidelity of a single microstructure and global flatness of embossed substrates, micro hot embossing at a low process temperature, but with good fidelity, should be preferred.",X.

  Engineering from Decompiled Codes","software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the practice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality illegally in the development of another software. java applications are more amenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such as decompilation because java class files store the program in a semi complied form called 'byte' codes. the existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the java class files. obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two level obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it more resilient to reverse engineering attacks. but source code obfuscation is much more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope of the different variables used in the program and only very little progress has been made on this front. hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of obscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and usability. to address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool jdatatrans to obfuscate java source code by obscuring the array usages. using various array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array folding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system obfuscate the input java source code and produce an obfuscated java source code that is functionally equivalent to the input program. we also perform a number of experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our tool.",Praveen Sivadasan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3503v1,2008-09-20T13:18:26Z,2008-09-20T13:18:26Z,cs.CR,['cs.CR'],2008,cs,CR

0909.5224v4,Deterministic counting of graph colourings using sequences of subgraphs,"in this paper we propose a deterministic algorithm for approximately counting the $k$-colourings of sparse random graphs $g(n,d/n)$. in particular, our algorithm computes in polynomial time a $(1\pm n^{-\omega(1)})$approximation of the logarithm of the number of $k$-colourings of $g(n,d/n)$ for $k\geq (2+\epsilon) d$ with high probability over the graph instances.   our algorithm is related to the algorithms of a. bandyopadhyay et al. in soda '06, and a. montanari et al. in soda '06, i.e. it uses {\em spatial correlation decay} to compute {\em deterministically} marginals of {\em gibbs distribution}. we develop a scheme whose accuracy depends on {\em non-reconstruction} of the colourings of $g(n,d/n)$, rather than {\em uniqueness} that are required in previous works. this leaves open the possibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.   the set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: given $g(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\lambda$ of the graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\lambda$. then we show that the effect of this change on the marginals of gibbs distribution, diminishes as we move away from $\lambda$. our approach is novel and suggests a new context for the study of deterministic counting algorithms.",Charilaos Efthymiou,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5224v4,2009-09-28T21:41:07Z,2013-06-11T19:20:40Z,cs.DM,"['cs.DM', 'G.2.1; G.3']",2009,cs,DM

0910.5002v1,An Iterative Shrinkage Approach to Total-Variation Image Restoration,"the problem of restoration of digital images from their degraded measurements plays a central role in a multitude of practically important applications. a particularly challenging instance of this problem occurs in the case when the degradation phenomenon is modeled by an ill-conditioned operator. in such a case, the presence of noise makes it impossible to recover a valuable approximation of the image of interest without using some a priori information about its properties. such a priori information is essential for image restoration, rendering it stable and robust to noise. particularly, if the original image is known to be a piecewise smooth function, one of the standard priors used in this case is defined by the rudin-osher-fatemi model, which results in total variation (tv) based image restoration. the current arsenal of algorithms for tv-based image restoration is vast. in the present paper, a different approach to the solution of the problem is proposed based on the method of iterative shrinkage (aka iterated thresholding). in the proposed method, the tv-based image restoration is performed through a recursive application of two simple procedures, viz. linear filtering and soft thresholding. therefore, the method can be identified as belonging to the group of first-order algorithms which are efficient in dealing with images of relatively large sizes. another valuable feature of the proposed method consists in its working directly with the tv functional, rather then with its smoothed versions. moreover, the method provides a single solution for both isotropic and anisotropic definitions of the tv functional, thereby establishing a useful connection between the two formulae.",Oleg Michailovich,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.5002v1,2009-10-26T22:50:18Z,2009-10-26T22:50:18Z,cs.CV,['cs.CV'],2009,cs,CV

  Graphs","the diameter of a graph is among its most basic parameters. since a few years, it moreover became a key issue to compute it for massive graphs in the context of complex network analysis. however, known algorithms, including the ones producing approximate values, have too high a time and/or space complexity to be used in such cases. we propose here a new approach relying on very simple and fast algorithms that compute (upper and lower) bounds for the diameter. we show empirically that, on various real-world cases representative of complex networks studied in the literature, the obtained bounds are very tight (and even equal in some cases). this leads to rigorous and very accurate estimations of the actual diameter in cases which were previously untractable in practice.",Clemence Magnien,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.2728v1,2009-04-17T15:44:49Z,2009-04-17T15:44:49Z,cs.DS,['cs.DS'],2009,cs,DS

1011.5384v1,Spectrum Sharing as Spatial Congestion Games,"in this paper, we present and analyze the properties of a new class of games - the spatial congestion game (scg), which is a generalization of the classical congestion game (cg). in a classical congestion game, multiple users share the same set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function of the total number of users sharing it. as a potential game, this game enjoys some very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy nash equilibrium (ne) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a ne (also called the finite improvement property or fip). while it's tempting to use this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse feature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels) may be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far away from each other. this motivates us to study an extended form of the congestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the number of its interfering users sharing it. this naturally results in a spatial congestion game (scg), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict graph). we study fundamental properties of a spatial congestion game; in particular, we seek to answer under what conditions this game possesses the finite improvement property or a nash equilibrium. we also discuss the implications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.",Sahand Ahmad,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.5384v1,2010-11-24T14:47:47Z,2010-11-24T14:47:47Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2010,cs,GT

(stoc10) recently showed that sequential posted-price mechanisms (spms), though simple in form, can perform surprisingly well compared to the optimal mechanisms. in this paper, we give a theoretical explanation of this fact, based on a connection to the notion of correlation gap.   loosely speaking, for auction environments with matroid constraints, we can relate the performance of a mechanism to the expectation of a monotone submodular function over a random set. this random set corresponds to the winner set for the optimal mechanism, which is highly correlated, and corresponds to certain demand set for spms, which is independent. the notion of correlation gap of agrawal et al.\ (soda10) quantifies how much we {}""lose"" in the expectation of the function by ignoring correlation in the random set, and hence bounds our loss in using certain spm instead of the optimal mechanism. furthermore, the correlation gap of a monotone and submodular function is known to be small, and it follows that certain spm can approximate the optimal mechanism by a good constant factor.   exploiting this connection, we give tight analysis of a greedy-based spm of chawla et al.\ for several environments. in particular, we show that it gives an $e/(e-1)$-approximation for matroid environments, gives asymptotically a $1/(1-1/\sqrt{2\pi k})$-approximation for the important sub-case of $k$-unit auctions, and gives a $(p+1)$-approximation for environments with $p$-independent set system constraints.",Qiqi Yan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1843v2,2010-08-11T07:20:53Z,2010-10-27T08:03:24Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2010,cs,GT

1107.2248v2,"Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria in Weighted Congestion Games:
  Existence, Efficient Computation, and Structure","we consider structural and algorithmic questions related to the nash dynamics of weighted congestion games. in weighted congestion games with linear latency functions, the existence of (pure nash) equilibria is guaranteed by potential function arguments. unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and computing equilibria is such games is a {\sf pls}-hard problem. the situation gets worse when superlinear latency functions come into play; in this case, the nash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and equilibria may not even exist. given these obstacles, we consider approximate equilibria as alternative solution concepts. do such equilibria exist? and if so, can we compute them efficiently?   we provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions by exploiting an ""approximation"" of such games by a new class of potential games that we call $\psi$-games. this allows us to show that these games have $d!$-approximate equilibria, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the latency functions. our main technical contribution is an efficient algorithm for computing o(1)-approximate equilibria when $d$ is a constant. for games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee is $\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}+o(\gamma)$ for arbitrarily small $\gamma>0$; for latency functions with maximum degree $d\geq 2$, it is $d^{2d+o(d)}$. the running time is polynomial in the number of bits in the representation of the game and $1/\gamma$. as a byproduct of our techniques, we also show the following structural statement for weighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree $d\geq 2$: polynomially-long sequences of best-response moves from any initial state to a $d^{o(d^2)}$-approximate equilibrium exist and can be efficiently identified in such games as long as $d$ is constant.",Ioannis Caragiannis,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2248v2,2011-07-12T11:21:16Z,2011-11-11T08:15:52Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs,GT

1111.0554v2,On a Bounded Budget Network Creation Game,"we consider a network creation game in which each player (vertex) has a fixed budget to establish links to other players. in our model, each link has unit price and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local diameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying graph of the created network. two versions of the game are studied: in the max version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and other vertices, and in the sum version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. we prove that in both versions pure nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding the best response of a vertex is np-hard. we take the social cost of the created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible diameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. when the sum of players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we prove that their maximum diameter is theta(n) and theta(log n) in max and sum versions, respectively. when each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either version is theta(1). we give examples of equilibrium graphs in the max version, such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is omega(sqrt(log n)). this interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. then we prove that every equilibrium graph in the sum version has diameter 2^o(sqrt(log n)). finally, we show that if the budget of each player is at least k, then every equilibrium graph in the sum version is k-connected or has diameter smaller than 4.",Shayan Ehsani,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0554v2,2011-11-02T16:11:07Z,2012-06-10T22:20:25Z,cs.GT,"['cs.GT', 'F.2.2; G.2.2']",2011,cs,GT

1112.4264v1,Bounded-Distance Network Creation Games,"a network creation game simulates a decentralized and non-cooperative building of a communication network. informally, there are $n$ players sitting on the network nodes, which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by activating, incurring a certain cost, any of their incident links. the goal of each player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the resulting network, while buying as few links as possible. according to this intuition, any model of the game must then appropriately address a balance between these two conflicting objectives. motivated by the fact that a player might have a strong requirement about its centrality in the network, in this paper we introduce a new setting in which if a player maintains its (either maximum or average) distance to the other nodes within a given associated bound, then its cost is simply equal to the number of activated edges, otherwise its cost is unbounded. we study the problem of understanding the structure of associated pure nash equilibria of the resulting games, that we call maxbd and sumbd, respectively. for both games, we show that computing the best response of a player is an np-hard problem. next, we show that when distance bounds associated with players are non-uniform, then equilibria can be arbitrarily bad. on the other hand, for maxbd, we show that when nodes have a uniform bound $r$ on the maximum distance, then the price of anarchy (poa) is lower and upper bounded by 2 and $o(n^{\frac{1}{\lfloor\log_3 r\rfloor+1}})$ for $r \geq 3$, while for the interesting case r=2, we are able to prove that the poa is $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $o(\sqrt{n \log n})$. for the uniform sumbd we obtain similar (asymptotically) results, and moreover we show that the poa becomes constant as soon as the bound on the average distance is $n^{\omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}})}$.",Davide Bilò,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.4264v1,2011-12-19T08:30:51Z,2011-12-19T08:30:51Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs,GT

  Mini-Sum-of-Squares Objective","we consider the problem of locating a public facility on a line, where a set of $n$ strategic agents report their \emph{locations} and a mechanism determines, either deterministically or randomly, the location of the facility. game theoretic perspectives of the facility location problem advanced in two main directions. the first direction is concerned with the characterization of \emph{strategyproof} (sp) mechanisms; i.e., mechanisms that induce truthful reporting as a dominant strategy; and the second direction quantifies how well various objective functions can be approximated when restricted to sp mechanisms. the current paper provides contributions in both directions. first, we construct a parameterized randomized sp mechanism, and show that all of the previously proposed deterministic and randomized sp mechanisms for the current settings can be formalized as special cases of this mechanism. second, we give tight results for the approximation ratio of sp mechanisms with respect to the objective of minimizing the sum of squares of distances to the agents (\emph{minisos}). holzman \cite{holzman1990} provided an axiomatic foundation for this function, showing that it is the unique function that satisfies unanimity, continuity and invariance. we devise a randomized mechanism that gives a 1.5-approximation for the minisos function, and show that no other randomized sp mechanism can provide a better approximation. this mechanism chooses the average location with probability 1/2 and a \emph{random dictator} with probability 1/2. for deterministic mechanisms, we show that the median mechanism provides a 2-approximation, and this is tight. together, our study provides fundamental understanding of the minisos objective function and makes a step toward the characterization of randomized sp facility location mechanisms.",Michal Feldman,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1762v4,2011-08-08T17:47:11Z,2013-10-26T20:34:06Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs,GT

1104.0235v1,Gaussian Robust Classification,"supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge. specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data correctly. in order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. the later can is done usually by adding a regularization term. the statistical learning theory explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the complexity of the learned model. this explanation, however, is rather abstract and does not have a geometric intuition. the generalization error of a classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize well. indeed, xu et al. [2009] have shown that the svm formulation is equivalent to a robust optimization (ro) formulation, in which an adversary displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined radius. in this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing each data point with a gaussian cloud centered at the sample. loss is evaluated as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. this setup fits the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. we develop an ro framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the noise. in our algorithm named guru, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative considerations. our experiments show that this framework performs as well as svm and even slightly better in some cases. generalizations for mercer kernels and for the multiclass case are presented as well. we also show that our framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective functions.",Ido Ginodi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.0235v1,2011-04-01T19:33:05Z,2011-04-01T19:33:05Z,cs.LG,['cs.LG'],2011,cs,LG

  Long-run Average Objectives","turn-based stochastic games and its important subclass markov decision processes (mdps) provide models for systems with both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. we consider turn-based stochastic games with two classical quantitative objectives: discounted-sum and long-run average objectives. the game models and the quantitative objectives are widely used in probabilistic verification, planning, optimal inventory control, network protocol and performance analysis. games and mdps that model realistic systems often have very large state spaces, and probabilistic abstraction techniques are necessary to handle the state-space explosion. the commonly used full-abstraction techniques do not yield space-savings for systems that have many states with similar value, but does not necessarily have similar transition structure. a semi-abstraction technique, namely magnifying-lens abstractions (mla), that clusters states based on value only, disregarding differences in their transition relation was proposed for qualitative objectives (reachability and safety objectives). in this paper we extend the mla technique to solve stochastic games with discounted-sum and long-run average objectives. we present the mla technique based abstraction-refinement algorithm for stochastic games and mdps with discounted-sum objectives. for long-run average objectives, our solution works for all mdps and a sub-class of stochastic games where every state has the same value.",Krishnendu Chatterjee,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2132v1,2011-07-11T20:19:26Z,2011-07-11T20:19:26Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs,GT
1107.5221v1,Competitive Auctions for Markets with Positive Externalities,"in digital goods auctions, there is an auctioneer who sells an item with unlimited supply to a set of potential buyers, and the objective is to design truthful auction to maximize the total profit of the auctioneer. motivated from an observation that the values of buyers for the item could be interconnected through social networks, we study digital goods auctions with positive externalities among the buyers. this defines a multi-parameter auction design problem where the private valuation of every buyer is a function of other winning buyers. the main contribution of this paper is a truthful competitive mechanism for subadditive valuations. our competitive result is with respect to a new solution benchmark $\mathcal{f}^{(3)}$; on the other hand, we show a surprising impossibility result if comparing to the benchmark $\mathcal{f}^{(2)}$, where the latter has been used quite successfully in digital goods auctions without extenalities \cite{goldberg2006}. our results from $\mathcal{f}^{(2)}$ to $\mathcal{f}^{(3)}$ could be considered as the loss of optimal profit at the cost of externalities.",Nick Gravin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.5221v1,2011-07-26T14:29:39Z,2011-07-26T14:29:39Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs,GT

  homogeneous braids","four constructions of seifert surfaces - hopf plumbing, arborescent plumbing, basketry, and t-bandword handle decomposition - are described, and some interrelationships found, e.g.: arborescent seifert surfaces are baskets; hopf-plumbed baskets are precisely homogeneous t-bandword surfaces.   a seifert surface is hopf-plumbed if it is a 2-disk d or if it can be constructed by plumbing a positive or negative hopf annulus a(o,-1) or a(o,1) to a hopf-plumbed surface along a proper arc. a seifert surface is a basket if it is d or it can be constructed by plumbing an n-twisted unknotted annulus a(o,n) to a basket along a proper arc in d. a seifert surface is arborescent if it is d, or it is a(o,n), or it can be constructed by plumbing a(o,n) to an arborescent seifert surface along a transverse arc of an annulus plumband. every arborescent seifert surface is a basket.   a tree t embedded in the complex plane c determines a set of generators for a braid group. an espalier is a tree in the closed lower halfplane with vertices on the real line r. if t is an espalier then words b in the t-generators correspond nicely to t-bandword surfaces s(b). (for example, if i is an espalier with an edge from p to p+1 for p=1,...,n-1, then the i-generators of the n-string braid group are the standard generators; when seifert's algorithm is applied to the closed braid diagram of a word in those generators, the result is an i-bandword surface.)   theorem. for any espalier t, a t-bandword surface s(b) is a hopf-plumbed basket iff b is homogeneous iff s(b) is a fiber surface iff s(b) is connected and incompressible. a hopf-plumbed basket s (for instance, an arborescent fiber surface) is isotopic to a homogeneous t-bandword surface for some espalier t.",Lee Rudolph,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9810095v3,1998-10-15T16:51:20Z,2000-05-20T15:20:44Z,math.GT,"['math.GT', '57M25']",1998,math,GT

math/0009256v1,Tree representations of Galois groups,"much work has gone into matrix representations of galois groups, but there is a whole new class of naturally occurring representations that have as yet gone almost unnoticed. in fact, it is well-known in various areas of mathematics that the main sources of totally disconnected groups are matrix groups over local fields and automorphism groups of locally finite trees. it is perhaps surprising then that representations of galois groups into the latter have been almost ignored, while at the same time galois representations into the former have been enormously effective in resolving long-standing problems in number theory.   these ``tree'' representations are important as regards topics such as the unramified fontaine-mazur conjecture. this conjecture states that any p-adic representation of the galois group of an extension unramified at p (and ramified at only finitely many primes) should have finite image. in other words, p-adic representations say little about such galois groups. this paper proposes the conjecture that these galois groups should, on the other hand, have representations with large image (measured by hausdorff dimension) in the automorphism group of a rooted tree. thus, they might allow us to investigate the structure of the galois group of infinite pro-p extensions (such as hilbert p-class towers), something unapproachable by standard p-adic representation methods.",Nigel Boston,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0009256v1,2000-09-18T00:00:00Z,2000-09-18T00:00:00Z,math.NT,['math.NT'],2000,math,NT

math/0603132v1,Functional linear regression analysis for longitudinal data,"we propose nonparametric methods for functional linear regression which are designed for sparse longitudinal data, where both the predictor and response are functions of a covariate such as time. predictor and response processes have smooth random trajectories, and the data consist of a small number of noisy repeated measurements made at irregular times for a sample of subjects. in longitudinal studies, the number of repeated measurements per subject is often small and may be modeled as a discrete random number and, accordingly, only a finite and asymptotically nonincreasing number of measurements are available for each subject or experimental unit. we propose a functional regression approach for this situation, using functional principal component analysis, where we estimate the functional principal component scores through conditional expectations. this allows the prediction of an unobserved response trajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. the resulting technique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of the measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. asymptotic properties for a sample of $n$ subjects are investigated under mild conditions, as $n\to \infty$, and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression function. besides convergence results for the components of functional linear regression, such as the regression parameter function, we construct asymptotic pointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. a functional coefficient of determination as a measure of the variance explained by the functional regression model is introduced, extending the standard $r^2$ to the functional case. the proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data and an analysis of the longitudinal relationship between blood pressure and body mass index.",Fang Yao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0603132v1,2006-03-06T08:09:42Z,2006-03-06T08:09:42Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62M20 (Primary) 60G15, 62G05 (Secondary)']",2006,math,ST

math/0610051v1,Fast Computation of Fourier Integral Operators,"we introduce a general purpose algorithm for rapidly computing certain types of oscillatory integrals which frequently arise in problems connected to wave propagation and general hyperbolic equations. the problem is to evaluate numerically a so-called fourier integral operator (fio) of the form $\int e^{2\pi i \phi(x,\xi)} a(x,\xi) \hat{f}(\xi) \mathrm{d}\xi$ at points given on a cartesian grid. here, $\xi$ is a frequency variable, $\hat f(\xi)$ is the fourier transform of the input $f$, $a(x,\xi)$ is an amplitude and $\phi(x,\xi)$ is a phase function, which is typically as large as $|\xi|$; hence the integral is highly oscillatory at high frequencies. because an fio is a dense matrix, a naive matrix vector product with an input given on a cartesian grid of size $n$ by $n$ would require $o(n^4)$ operations.   this paper develops a new numerical algorithm which requires $o(n^{2.5} \log n)$ operations, and as low as $o(\sqrt{n})$ in storage space. it operates by localizing the integral over polar wedges with small angular aperture in the frequency plane. on each wedge, the algorithm factorizes the kernel $e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,\xi)} a(x,\xi)$ into two components: 1) a diffeomorphism which is handled by means of a nonuniform fft and 2) a residual factor which is handled by numerical separation of the spatial and frequency variables. the key to the complexity and accuracy estimates is that the separation rank of the residual kernel is \emph{provably independent of the problem size}. several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology. we also discuss the potential of our ideas for various applications such as reflection seismology.",Emmanuel Candes,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0610051v1,2006-10-01T19:12:53Z,2006-10-01T19:12:53Z,math.NA,"['math.NA', '35S30; 65F30; 86A15']",2006,math,NA

  survivor function from right censored prevalent cohort data","right censored survival data collected on a cohort of prevalent cases with constant incidence are length-biased, and may be used to estimate the length-biased (i.e., prevalent-case) survival function. when the incidence rate is constant, so-called stationarity of the incidence, it is more efficient to use this structure for unconditional statistical inference than to carry out an analysis by conditioning on the observed truncation times. it is well known that, due to the informative censoring for prevalent cohort data, the kaplan--meier estimator is not the unconditional npmle of the length-biased survival function and the asymptotic properties of the npmle do not follow from any known result. we present here a detailed derivation of the asymptotic properties of the npmle of the length-biased survival function from right censored prevalent cohort survival data with follow-up. in particular, we show that the npmle is uniformly strongly consistent, converges weakly to a gaussian process, and is asymptotically efficient. one important spin-off from these results is that they yield the asymptotic properties of the npmle of the incident-case survival function [see asgharian, m'lan and wolfson j. amer. statist. assoc. 97 (2002) 201--209], which is often of prime interest in a prevalent cohort study. our results generalize those given by vardi and zhang [ann. statist. 20 (1992) 1022--1039] under multiplicative censoring, which we show arises as a degenerate case in a prevalent cohort setting.",Masoud Asgharian,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0602239v1,2006-02-11T10:31:08Z,2006-02-11T10:31:08Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62G20 (Primary) 62N02 (Secondary)']",2006,math,ST

0706.0246v3,Approximately bisimilar symbolic models for nonlinear control systems,"control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how physical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs. although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena, they are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the physical world. for this reason there is a growing interest in describing control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the continuous dynamics, where each ""symbol"" corresponds to an ""aggregate"" of states in the continuous model. since these symbolic models are of the same nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which software and hardware interact with the physical world. furthermore the use of symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. in this paper we show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. the approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic model and can be rendered as small as desired. furthermore if the state space of the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. for digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental input-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable quantization of the inputs.",Giordano Pola,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0246v3,2007-06-02T01:47:09Z,2008-01-14T04:24:38Z,math.OC,"['math.OC', '93A30']",2007,math,OC
