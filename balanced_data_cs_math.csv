cs/9809002v1,Tally NP Sets and Easy Census Functions,"we study the question of whether every p set has an easy (i.e., polynomial-time computable) census function. we characterize this question in terms of unlikely collapses of language and function classes such as the containment of #p_1 in fp, where #p_1 is the class of functions that count the witnesses for tally np sets. we prove that every #p_{1}^{ph} function can be computed in fp^{#p_{1}^{#p_{1}}}. consequently, every p set has an easy census function if and only if every set in the polynomial hierarchy does. we show that the assumption of #p_1 being contained in fp implies p = bpp and that ph is contained in mod_{k}p for each k \geq 2, which provides further evidence that not all sets in p have an easy census function. we also relate a set's property of having an easy census function to other well-studied properties of sets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable sets under p-isomorphisms). finally, we prove that it is no more likely that the census function of any set in p can be approximated (more precisely, can be n^{\alpha}-enumerated in time n^{\beta} for fixed \alpha and \beta) than that it can be precisely computed in polynomial time.",Judy Goldsmith,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9809002v1,1998-09-01T12:15:55Z,1998-09-01T12:15:55Z,cs.CC,"['cs.CC', 'F.1.3']",1998,cs

  Prototyping of Signal Processing","as the one-chip integration of hw-modules designed by different companies becomes more and more popular reliability of a hw-design and evaluation of the timing behavior during the prototype stage are absolutely necessary. one way to guarantee reliability is the use of robust design styles, e.g., delay-insensitivity. for early timing evaluation two aspects must be considered: a) the timing needs to be proportional to technology variations and b) the implemented architecture should be identical for prototype and target. the first can be met also by delay-insensitive implementation. the latter one is the key point. a unified architecture is needed for prototyping as well as implementation. our new approach to rapid prototyping of signal processing tasks is based on a configurable, delay-insensitive implemented processor called flysig. in essence, the flysig processor can be understood as a complex fpga where the clbs are substituted by bit-serial operators. in this paper the general concept is detailed and first experimental results are given for demonstration of the main advantages: delay-insensitive design style, direct correspondence between prototyping and target architecture, high performance and reasonable shortening of the design cycle.",Wolfram Hardt,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9810011v1,1998-10-12T10:11:05Z,1998-10-12T10:11:05Z,cs.AR,"['cs.AR', 'C.1.3; C.3']",1998,cs

(a) and (b) both share the wrong belief that to a word must correspond a simple entity that is its meaning. i then turn to the semantic rules that pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel features, they are in a well-established artificial intelligence tradition of explaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures assigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. it is argued that fodor and lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without foundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical worth in computational systems. their justification descends from line of argument, whose high points were probably wittgenstein and quine that meaning is not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise, but by the relationship of whole cultural representational structures to each other and to the world as a whole.",Yorick Wilks,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9902029v1,1999-02-25T14:41:24Z,1999-02-25T14:41:24Z,cs.CL,"['cs.CL', 'I.2']",1999,cs

  Predicates","for logic programs with arithmetic predicates, showing termination is not easy, since the usual order for the integers is not well-founded. a new method, easily incorporated in the termilog system for automatic termination analysis, is presented for showing termination in this case.   the method consists of the following steps: first, a finite abstract domain for representing the range of integers is deduced automatically. based on this abstraction, abstract interpretation is applied to the program. the result is a finite number of atoms abstracting answers to queries which are used to extend the technique of query-mapping pairs. for each query-mapping pair that is potentially non-terminating, a bounded (integer-valued) termination function is guessed. if traversing the pair decreases the value of the termination function, then termination is established. simple functions often suffice for each query-mapping pair, and that gives our approach an edge over the classical approach of using a single termination function for all loops, which must inevitably be more complicated and harder to guess automatically. it is worth noting that the termination of mccarthy's 91 function can be shown automatically using our method.   in summary, the proposed approach is based on combining a finite abstraction of the integers with the technique of the query-mapping pairs, and is essentially capable of dividing a termination proof into several cases, such that a simple termination function suffices for each case. consequently, the whole process of proving termination can be done automatically in the framework of termilog and similar systems.",Nachum Dershowitz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011036v1,2000-11-23T09:56:03Z,2000-11-23T09:56:03Z,cs.PL,"['cs.PL', 'D.1.6; D.2.4']",2000,cs

cs/0004006v1,On Redundancy Elimination Tolerant Scheduling Rules,"in (ferrucci, pacini and sessa, 1995) an extended form of resolution, called reduced sld resolution (rsld), is introduced. in essence, an rsld derivation is an sld derivation such that redundancy elimination from resolvents is performed after each rewriting step. it is intuitive that redundancy elimination may have positive effects on derivation process. however, undesiderable effects are also possible. in particular, as shown in this paper, program termination as well as completeness of loop checking mechanisms via a given selection rule may be lost. the study of such effects has led us to an analysis of selection rule basic concepts, so that we have found convenient to move the attention from rules of atom selection to rules of atom scheduling. a priority mechanism for atom scheduling is built, where a priority is assigned to each atom in a resolvent, and primary importance is given to the event of arrival of new atoms from the body of the applied clause at rewriting time. this new computational model proves able to address the study of redundancy elimination effects, giving at the same time interesting insights into general properties of selection rules. as a matter of fact, a class of scheduling rules, namely the specialisation independent ones, is defined in the paper by using not trivial semantic arguments. as a quite surprising result, specialisation independent scheduling rules turn out to coincide with a class of rules which have an immediate structural characterisation (named stack-queue rules). then we prove that such scheduling rules are tolerant to redundancy elimination, in the sense that neither program termination nor completeness of equality loop check is lost passing from sld to rsld.",F.

cs/0011044v1,Scaling Up Inductive Logic Programming by Learning from Interpretations,"when comparing inductive logic programming (ilp) and attribute-value learning techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency. inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. the main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ilp algorithms. in this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. we relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ilp setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ilp setting).   as a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ilp system tilde (top-down induction of logical decision trees): tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and tilde-lds, which loads the examples one by one. we experimentally compare the implementations, showing tilde-lds can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 mb) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.",Hendrik Blockeel,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011044v1,2000-11-29T12:14:50Z,2000-11-29T12:14:50Z,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', 'I.2.6 ; I.2.3']",2000,cs

(*) $$   this claim, if true, says that equality translates downwards between levels of the bounded-query hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy levels that (before the fact) are immediately below them.   until recently, it was not known whether (*) {\em ever\/} held, except for the degenerate cases $m=0$ and $k=0$. then hemaspaandra, hemaspaandra, and hempel \cite{hem-hem-hem:j:downward-translation} proved that (*) holds for all $m$, for $k > 2$. buhrman and fortnow~\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries} then showed that, when $k=2$, (*) holds for the case $m = 1$. in this paper, we prove that for the case $k=2$, (*) holds for all values of $m$. since there is an oracle relative to which ``for $k=1$, (*) holds for all $m$'' fails \cite{buh-for:j:two-queries}, our achievement of the $k=2$ case cannot to be strengthened to $k=1$ by any relativizable proof technique. the new downward translation we obtain also tightens the collapse in the polynomial hierarchy implied by a collapse in the bounded-query hierarchy of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.",Edith Hemaspaandra,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0106037v1,2001-06-15T11:07:02Z,2001-06-15T11:07:02Z,cs.CC,"['cs.CC', 'F.1.3; F.1.2']",2001,cs

  800-Number Portability","do switching costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where firms charge the same price to old and new consumers? theoretically, the answer could be either ""yes"" or ""no,"" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing decisions. the firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers who are ""locked-in"" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher future profitability. i demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon theoretical model.   800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer this question. before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change service providers. this imposed significant switching costs on users, who generally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. in may 1993 a new database made 800-numbers portable. this drop in switching costs and regulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers provide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.   i use contracts for virtual private network (vpn) services to test how at&t adjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability. preliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), i find that at&t reduced margins for vpn contracts containing toll-free services relative to those that did not as the portability date approached. this implies that the switching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. these results suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this time period, at&t's incentive to charge a higher price to ""locked-in"" consumers exceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era of non-portability.",V.

  Jurisdiction","the unique challenge presented by the internet is that compliance with local laws is rarely sufficient to assure a business that it has limited its exposure to legal risk. the paper identifies why the challenge of adequately accounting for the legal risk arising from internet jurisdiction has been aggravated in recent years by the adoption of the zippo legal framework, commonly referred to as the passive versus active test. the test provides parties with only limited guidance and often results in detrimental judicial decisions from a policy perspective. given the inadequacies of the zippo passive versus active test, the paper argues that it is now fitting to identify a more effective standard for determining when it is appropriate to assert jurisdiction in cases involving predominantly internet-based contacts. the solution submitted in the paper is to move toward a targeting-based analysis. unlike the zippo approach, a targeting analysis would seek to identify the intentions of the parties and to assess the steps taken to either enter or avoid a particular jurisdiction. targeting would also lessen the reliance on effects-based analysis, the source of considerable uncertainty since internet-based activity can ordinarily be said to create some effects in most jurisdictions. to identify the appropriate criteria for a targeting test, the paper recommends returning to the core jurisdictional principle -- foreseeability. foreseeability in the targeting context depends on three factors -- contracts, technology, and actual or implied knowledge.",Michael Geist,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109012v1,2001-09-11T03:22:25Z,2001-09-11T03:22:25Z,cs.CY,"['cs.CY', 'K.4.m Miscellaneous']",2001,cs

  experience","oz is a multiparadigm language that supports logic programming as one of its major paradigms. a multiparadigm language is designed to support different programming paradigms (logic, functional, constraint, object-oriented, sequential, concurrent, etc.) with equal ease. this article has two goals: to give a tutorial of logic programming in oz and to show how logic programming fits naturally into the wider context of multiparadigm programming. our experience shows that there are two classes of problems, which we call algorithmic and search problems, for which logic programming can help formulate practical solutions. algorithmic problems have known efficient algorithms. search problems do not have known efficient algorithms but can be solved with search. the oz support for logic programming targets these two problem classes specifically, using the concepts needed for each. this is in contrast to the prolog approach, which targets both classes with one set of concepts, which results in less than optimal support for each class. to explain the essential difference between algorithmic and search programs, we define the oz execution model. this model subsumes both concurrent logic programming (committed-choice-style) and search-based logic programming (prolog-style). instead of horn clause syntax, oz has a simple, fully compositional, higher-order syntax that accommodates the abilities of the language. we conclude with lessons learned from this work, a brief history of oz, and many entry points into the oz literature.",Peter Van Roy,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0208029v1,2002-08-20T11:12:58Z,2002-08-20T11:12:58Z,cs.PL,"['cs.PL', 'D.1.6; D.3.2; D.3.3; F.3.3']",2002,cs

cs/0207087v1,Axiomatic Aspects of Default Inference,"this paper studies axioms for nonmonotonic consequences from a semantics-based point of view, focusing on a class of mathematical structures for reasoning about partial information without a predefined syntax/logic. this structure is called a default structure. we study axioms for the nonmonotonic consequence relation derived from extensions as in reiter's default logic, using skeptical reasoning, but extensions are now used for the construction of possible worlds in a default information structure.   in previous work we showed that skeptical reasoning arising from default-extensions obeys a well-behaved set of axioms including the axiom of cautious cut. we show here that, remarkably, the converse is also true: any consequence relation obeying this set of axioms can be represented as one constructed from skeptical reasoning. we provide representation theorems to relate axioms for nonmonotonic consequence relation and properties about extensions, and provide one-to-one correspondence between nonmonotonic systems which satisfies the law of cautious monotony and default structures with unique extensions. our results give a theoretical justification for a set of basic rules governing the update of nonmonotonic knowledge bases, demonstrating the derivation of them from the more concrete and primitive construction of extensions. it is also striking to note that proofs of the representation theorems show that only shallow extensions are necessary, in the sense that the number of iterations needed to achieve an extension is at most three. all of these developments are made possible by taking a more liberal view of consistency: consistency is a user defined predicate, satisfying some basic properties.",Guo-Qiang Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207087v1,2002-07-25T16:19:51Z,2002-07-25T16:19:51Z,cs.LO,"['cs.LO', 'F.4.1; I.2.3']",2002,cs
cs/0205076v1,Complexity of Manipulating Elections with Few Candidates,"in multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences, preference aggregation is a central issue. voting is a general method for preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting protocols are manipulable. one could try to avoid manipulation by using voting protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. especially among computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by computational complexity. some earlier work has been done in this area, but it was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. we derive hardness results for practical multiagent settings where the number of candidates is small but the number of voters can be large. we show that with complete information about the others' votes, individual manipulation is easy, and coalitional manipulation is easy with unweighted voters. however, constructive coalitional manipulation with weighted voters is intractable for all of the voting protocols under study, except for the nonrandomized cup. destructive manipulation tends to be easier. randomizing over instantiations of the protocols (such as schedules of the cup protocol) can be used to make manipulation hard. finally, we show that under weak assumptions, if weighted coalitional manipulation with complete information about the others' votes is hard in some voting protocol, then individual and unweighted manipulation is hard when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.",Vincent Conitzer,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205076v1,2002-05-29T20:27:58Z,2002-05-29T20:27:58Z,cs.GT,"['cs.GT', 'I.2.11']",2002,cs
cs/0203005v2,A Framework for Compiling Preferences in Logic Programs,"we introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. an ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. an ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. first, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. we then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of brewka and eiter, can be captured within our framework. since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. to this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems.",J.

cs/0211010v2,Efficient Tree Layout in a Multilevel Memory Hierarchy,"we consider the problem of laying out a tree with fixed parent/child structure in hierarchical memory. the goal is to minimize the expected number of block transfers performed during a search along a root-to-leaf path, subject to a given probability distribution on the leaves. this problem was previously considered by gil and itai, who developed optimal but slow algorithms when the block-transfer size b is known. we present faster but approximate algorithms for the same problem; the fastest such algorithm runs in linear time and produces a solution that is within an additive constant of optimal.   in addition, we show how to extend any approximately optimal algorithm to the cache-oblivious setting in which the block-transfer size is unknown to the algorithm. the query performance of the cache-oblivious layout is within a constant factor of the query performance of the optimal known-block-size layout. computing the cache-oblivious layout requires only logarithmically many calls to the layout algorithm for known block size; in particular, the cache-oblivious layout can be computed in o(n lg n) time, where n is the number of nodes.   finally, we analyze two greedy strategies, and show that they have a performance ratio between omega(lg b / lg lg b) and o(lg b) when compared to the optimal layout.",Stephen Alstrup,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0211010v2,2002-11-12T03:32:02Z,2004-07-28T21:03:35Z,cs.DS,"['cs.DS', 'E.1; F.2.2']",2002,cs

cs/0203018v1,Improving Table Compression with Combinatorial Optimization,"we study the problem of compressing massive tables within the partition-training paradigm introduced by buchsbaum et al. [soda'00], in which a table is partitioned by an off-line training procedure into disjoint intervals of columns, each of which is compressed separately by a standard, on-line compressor like gzip. we provide a new theory that unifies previous experimental observations on partitioning and heuristic observations on column permutation, all of which are used to improve compression rates. based on the theory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression, which can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating sources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by rearranging columns prior to partitioning. we demonstrate these results experimentally. on various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55% improvement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering provides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone. we also show that a variation of the table compression problem is max-snp hard.",Adam L.

cs/0207002v1,Using eigenvectors of the bigram graph to infer morpheme identity,"this paper describes the results of some experiments exploring statistical methods to infer syntactic behavior of words and morphemes from a raw corpus in an unsupervised fashion. it shares certain points in common with brown et al (1992) and work that has grown out of that: it employs statistical techniques to analyze syntactic behavior based on what words occur adjacent to a given word. however, we use an eigenvector decomposition of a nearest-neighbor graph to produce a two-dimensional rendering of the words of a corpus in which words of the same syntactic category tend to form neighborhoods. we exploit this technique for extending the value of automatic learning of morphology. in particular, we look at the suffixes derived from a corpus by unsupervised learning of morphology, and we ask which of these suffixes have a consistent syntactic function (e.g., in english, -tion is primarily a mark of nouns, but -s marks both noun plurals and 3rd person present on verbs), and we determine that this method works well for this task.",Mikhail Belkin,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207002v1,2002-07-02T01:15:33Z,2002-07-02T01:15:33Z,cs.CL,"['cs.CL', 'I.2.7']",2002,cs

cs/0209019v1,Reasoning about Evolving Nonmonotonic Knowledge Bases,"recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. in this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an update policy. we first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. we then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. in particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. in more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity.",T.

cs/0205029v1,A Codebook Generation Algorithm for Document Image Compression,"pattern-matching-based document-compression systems (e.g. for faxing) rely on finding a small set of patterns that can be used to represent all of the ink in the document. finding an optimal set of patterns is np-hard; previous compression schemes have resorted to heuristics. this paper describes an extension of the cross-entropy approach, used previously for measuring pattern similarity, to this problem. this approach reduces the problem to a k-medians problem, for which the paper gives a new algorithm with a provably good performance guarantee. in comparison to previous heuristics (first fit, with and without generalized lloyd's/k-means postprocessing steps), the new algorithm generates a better codebook, resulting in an overall improvement in compression performance of almost 17%.",Qin Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205029v1,2002-05-17T23:52:11Z,2002-05-17T23:52:11Z,cs.DS,"['cs.DS', 'F.2.0, E.4, I.4.2']",2002,cs

  Techniques","in heterogeneous networks such as today's internet, the differentiated services architecture promises to provide qos guarantees through scalable service differentiation. traffic marking is an important component of this framework. in this paper, we propose two new aggregate markers that are stateless, scalable and fair. we leverage stateless active queue management (aqm) algorithms to enable fair and efficient token distribution among individual flows of an aggregate. the first marker, probabilistic aggregate marker (pam), uses the token bucket burst size to probabilistically mark incoming packets to ensure tcp-friendly and proportionally fair marking. the second marker, stateless aggregate fair marker (f-sam) approximates fair queueing techniques to isolate flows while marking packets of the aggregate. it distributes tokens evenly among the flows without maintaining per-flow state. our simulation results show that our marking strategies show upto 30% improvement over other commonly used markers while marking flow aggregates. these improvements are in terms of better average throughput and fairness indices, in scenarios containing heterogeneous traffic consisting of tcp (both long lived elephants and short lived mice) and misbehaving udp flows. as a bonus, f-sam helps the mice to win the war against elephants.",Abhimanyu Das,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0204011v1,2002-04-08T08:12:25Z,2002-04-08T08:12:25Z,cs.NI,"['cs.NI', 'C.2.6']",2002,cs

cs/0307056v1,From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief,"an intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. for example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. this paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. we call our approach the random-worlds method. the method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. it is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. for example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems.",Fahiem Bacchus,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0307056v1,2003-07-24T21:32:09Z,2003-07-24T21:32:09Z,cs.AI,"['cs.AI', 'I.2.4']",2003,cs

(by a multigraph we mean a graph in which multiple edges, but no loops, are allowed.) unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in ramsey theory which imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in a graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only requires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s incident edges is bounded by $m$. note that the number of colors found in a graph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. we prove that given any $n \times n$ complete bipartite multigraph $g$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local coloring displays a monochromatic copy of $k_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1) < n$. moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and $m=3\cdot 2^{k-2}$ for every integer $k\geq 2$. as for the lower bound of $p$, we show that the existence of a monochromatic $k_{p,p}$ is not guaranteed if $p> \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil$. finally, we give a generalization for $k$-partite graphs and a method applicable to general graphs. many conclusions found in $m$-local coloring can be inferred to similar results of $m$-coloring.",Ming-Yang Chen,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0305006v1,2003-05-12T16:17:18Z,2003-05-12T16:17:18Z,cs.DM,"['cs.DM', 'G.2.2']",2003,cs

cs/0409012v3,A New Look at Survey Propagation and its Generalizations,"this paper provides a new conceptual perspective on survey propagation, which is an iterative algorithm recently introduced by the statistical physics community that is very effective in solving random k-sat problems even with densities close to the satisfiability threshold. we first describe how any sat formula can be associated with a novel family of markov random fields (mrfs), parameterized by a real number \rho \in [0,1]. we then show that applying belief propagation--a well-known ``message-passing'' technique for estimating marginal probabilities--to this family of mrfs recovers a known family of algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (\rho = 1) to standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over sat assignments at the other extreme (\rho = 0). configurations in these mrfs have a natural interpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order can be defined. we isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering, which are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with positive probability in the mrf for \rho=1. our experimental results for k=3 suggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial cores. this makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial assignments for \rho<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very close to being cores. to that end, we investigate the associated lattice structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any mrf with \rho>0 can be viewed as a ``smoothed'' version of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments (\rho=0). finally, we isolate properties of gibbs sampling and message-passing algorithms that are typical for an ensemble of k-sat problems.",Eliza N.

cs/0509014v1,Density Evolution for Asymmetric Memoryless Channels,"density evolution is one of the most powerful analytical tools for low-density parity-check (ldpc) codes and graph codes with message passing decoding algorithms. with channel symmetry as one of its fundamental assumptions, density evolution (de) has been widely and successfully applied to different channels, including binary erasure channels, binary symmetric channels, binary additive white gaussian noise channels, etc. this paper generalizes density evolution for non-symmetric memoryless channels, which in turn broadens the applications to general memoryless channels, e.g. z-channels, composite white gaussian noise channels, etc. the central theorem underpinning this generalization is the convergence to perfect projection for any fixed size supporting tree. a new iterative formula of the same complexity is then presented and the necessary theorems for the performance concentration theorems are developed. several properties of the new density evolution method are explored, including stability results for general asymmetric memoryless channels. simulations, code optimizations, and possible new applications suggested by this new density evolution method are also provided. this result is also used to prove the typicality of linear ldpc codes among the coset code ensemble when the minimum check node degree is sufficiently large. it is shown that the convergence to perfect projection is essential to the belief propagation algorithm even when only symmetric channels are considered. hence the proof of the convergence to perfect projection serves also as a completion of the theory of classical density evolution for symmetric memoryless channels.",C. -C.

  Programming: A Meta-Interpreter and Applications","answer set programming (asp) with disjunction offers a powerful tool for declaratively representing and solving hard problems. many np-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical ""guess and check"" nature of np problems: the property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. however, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (dlps) is beyond np, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. while these problems also have a clear ""guess and check"" structure, finding an encoding in a dlp reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the ""check"" itself is a conp-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. in this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. the answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program. our transformations facilitate the integration of separate ""guess"" and ""check"" programs, which are often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program. our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in asp, and extend methods and techniques for a declarative ""guess and check"" problem solving paradigm through asp.",Thomas Eiter,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0501084v1,2005-01-28T20:19:12Z,2005-01-28T20:19:12Z,cs.AI,"['cs.AI', 'I.2.3; F.4.1']",2005,cs

cs/0501062v1,On The Tradeoff Between Two Types of Processing Gain,"one of the features characterizing almost every multiple access (ma) communication system is the processing gain. through the use of spreading sequences, the processing gain of random cdma systems (rcdma), is devoted to both bandwidth expansion and orthogonalization of the signals transmitted by different users. another type of multiple access system is impulse radio (ir). in many aspects, ir systems are similar to time division multiple access (tdma) systems, and the processing gain of ir systems represents the ratio between the actual transmission time and the total time between two consecutive ransmissions (on-plus-off to on ratio). while cdma systems, which constantly excite the channel, rely on spreading sequences to orthogonalize the signals transmitted by different users, ir systems transmit a series of short pulses and the orthogonalization between the signals transmitted by different users is achieved by the fact that most of the pulses do not collide with each other at the receiver.   in this paper, a general class of ma communication systems that use both types of processing gain is presented, and both ir and rcdma systems are demonstrated to be two special cases of this more general class of systems. the bit error rate (ber) of several receivers as a function of the ratio between the two types of processing gain is analyzed and compared under the constraint that the total processing gain of the system is large and fixed. it is demonstrated that in non inter-symbol interference (isi) channels there is no tradeoff between the two types of processing gain. however, in isi channels a tradeoff between the two types of processing gain exists. in addition, the sub-optimality of rcdma systems in frequency selective channels is established.",Eran Fishler,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0501062v1,2005-01-22T17:11:00Z,2005-01-22T17:11:00Z,cs.IT,"['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2005,cs

0710.4410v1,A Multi-level Blocking Distinct Degree Factorization Algorithm,"we give a new algorithm for performing the distinct-degree factorization of a polynomial p(x) over gf(2), using a multi-level blocking strategy. the coarsest level of blocking replaces gcd computations by multiplications, as suggested by pollard (1975), von zur gathen and shoup (1992), and others. the novelty of our approach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by squarings, which speeds up the computation in gf(2)[x]/p(x) of certain interval polynomials when p(x) is sparse. as an application we give a fast algorithm to search for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over gf(2), while producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full search. naive algorithms cost o(r^2) per trinomial, thus o(r^3) to search over all trinomials of given degree r. under a plausible assumption about the distribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity o(r^2 (log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r. our implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the naive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a mersenne exponent). using our program, we have found two new primitive trinomials of degree 24036583 over gf(2) (the previous record degree was 6972593).",Richard Brent,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.4410v1,2007-10-24T09:18:33Z,2007-10-24T09:18:33Z,cs.DS,['cs.DS'],2007,cs

(ii) if exponential sums of easy to compute polynomials can be computed efficiently, then the same is true of exponential products. we point out an application of this result to the p=np problem in the blum-shub-smale model of computation over the field of complex numbers.",Pascal Koiran,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.0360v1,2007-10-01T18:58:19Z,2007-10-01T18:58:19Z,cs.CC,['cs.CC'],2007,cs
cs/0702151v3,Succinct Sampling on Streams,"a streaming model is one where data items arrive over long period of time, either one item at a time or in bursts. typical tasks include computing various statistics over a sliding window of some fixed time-horizon. what makes the streaming model interesting is that as the time progresses, old items expire and new ones arrive. one of the simplest and central tasks in this model is sampling. that is, the task of maintaining up to $k$ uniformly distributed items from a current time-window as old items expire and new ones arrive. we call sampling algorithms {\bf succinct} if they use provably optimal (up to constant factors) {\bf worst-case} memory to maintain $k$ items (either with or without replacement). we stress that in many applications structures that have {\em expected} succinct representation as the time progresses are not sufficient, as small probability events eventually happen with probability 1. thus, in this paper we ask the following question: are succinct sampling on streams (or $s^3$-algorithms)possible, and if so for what models? perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we show that $s^3$-algorithms are possible for {\em all} variants of the problem mentioned above, i.e. both with and without replacement and both for one-at-a-time and bursty arrival models. finally, we use $s^3$ algorithms to solve various problems in sliding windows model, including frequency moments, counting triangles, entropy and density estimations. for these problems we present \emph{first} solutions with provable worst-case memory guarantees.",Vladimir Braverman,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0702151v3,2007-02-25T17:20:48Z,2008-04-14T16:30:01Z,cs.DS,['cs.DS'],2007,cs

  Network","this paper considers the requirements to ensure bounded mean queuing delay and non-starvation in a slotted aloha network operating the exponential backoff protocol. it is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted aloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. indeed, a saturation throughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r = e/(e-1)=1.5820. the binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority of prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the ethernet and wifi. for slotted aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r = 2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise objection to adopting r = 2 in the system. however, this paper shows that if mean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2 is only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . fortunately, the optimal setting of r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve sustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to 1/e. a general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the queuing delay performance. besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper also delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived of service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system. specifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that the conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are one of the same, thus uniting these two notions. finally, we show that when mean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained from simulation experiments may not converge. a quantitative discussion of this issue is provided in this paper.",Soung Chang Liew,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.4054v2,2008-01-26T02:36:30Z,2008-07-14T11:05:09Z,cs.NI,['cs.NI'],2008,cs

  algorithms","we present in this short note a polynomial graph extension procedure that can be used to improve any graph isomorphism algorithm. this construction propagates new constraints from the isomorphism constraints of the input graphs (denoted by $g(v,e)$ and $g'(v',e')$). thus, information from the edge structures of $g$ and $g'$ is ""hashed"" into the weighted edges of the extended graphs. a bijective mapping is an isomorphism of the initial graphs if and only if it is an isomorphism of the extended graphs. as such, the construction enables the identification of pair of vertices $i\in v$ and $i'\in v'$ that can not be mapped by any isomorphism $h^*:v \to v'$ (e.g. if the extended edges of $i$ and $i'$ are different). a forbidding matrix $f$, that encodes all pairs of incompatible mappings $(i,i')$, is constructed in order to be used by a different algorithm. moreover, tests on numerous graph classes show that the matrix $f$ might leave only one compatible element for each $i \in v$.",Daniel Cosmin Porumbel,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0136v2,2009-03-01T12:54:57Z,2009-03-03T07:31:53Z,cs.DS,['cs.DS'],2009,cs

1009.5773v4,Fast Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communications,"we consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of delay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. existing research on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely power-control and adaptive modulation and coding (amc), or system-level solutions based on dynamic power management (dpm); however, there is currently no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both physical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum possible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of stochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. in this report, we propose such a framework. we formulate the stochastic optimization problem as a markov decision process (mdp) and solve it online using reinforcement learning. the advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does not require a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to determine the jointly optimal power-control, amc, and dpm policies; (ii) it exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and (iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the adaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can converge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning algorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude faster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.",Nicholas Mastronarde,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.5773v4,2010-09-29T05:23:20Z,2013-06-05T01:57:55Z,cs.LG,['cs.LG'],2010,cs

1007.1333v2,"Minimisation of Deterministic Parity and Buchi Automata and Relative
  Minimisation of Deterministic Finite Automata","in this report we study the problem of minimising deterministic automata over finite and infinite words. deterministic finite automata are the simplest devices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic buchi, co-buchi, and parity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \omega-regular languages. while it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite and weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic buchi and parity automata has remained an open challenge. we establish the np-completeness of these problems. a second contribution of this report is the introduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. like hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the language of the automaton: we seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a system. we argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic buchi (or co-buchi) automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. when we allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation from the perspective of finite automata. from the perspective of buchi and co-buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space reductions put on top of it.",Sven Schewe,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.1333v2,2010-07-08T10:18:05Z,2011-03-14T15:59:24Z,cs.FL,"['cs.FL', '68Q45', 'F.1.1']",2010,cs

  Cell-Oriented Approach Using Group Theory","we present a novel approach to finding critical points in cell-wise barycentrically or bilinearly interpolated vector fields on surfaces. the poincar\e index of the critical points is determined by investigating the qualitative behavior of 0-level sets of the interpolants of the vector field components in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus avoiding the computation of the jacobian of the vector field at the critical points in order to determine its index. the locations of the critical points within a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. this approach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order critical points or one second-order critical point of bilinearly interpolated vector fields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field only. we show that for the considered interpolation schemes determining the index of a critical point can be seen as a coloring problem of cell edges. a complete classification of all possible colorings in terms of the types and number of critical points yielded by each coloring is given using computational group theory. we present an efficient algorithm that makes use of these precomputed classifications in order to find and classify critical points in a cell-by-cell fashion. issues of numerical stability, construction of the topological skeleton, topological simplification, and the statistics of the different types of critical points are also discussed.",Felix Effenberger,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.4485v1,2010-04-26T11:26:33Z,2010-04-26T11:26:33Z,cs.GR,"['cs.GR', '68-04, 68R05']",2010,cs

1009.3613v5,On the Doubt about Margin Explanation of Boosting,"margin theory provides one of the most popular explanations to the success of \texttt{adaboost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that \textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of \texttt{adaboost}. this theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been used to argue that \texttt{adaboost} usually does not overfit since it tends to enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. previously the \textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \texttt{adaboost}, however, \cite{breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to a better generalization. later, \cite{reyzin:schapire2006} emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial to the performance of \texttt{adaboost}. in this paper, we first present the \textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous work such as the minimum margin bound and emargin bound. then, we improve the previous empirical bernstein bounds \citep{maurer:pontil2009,audibert:munos:szepesvari2009}, and based on such findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against breiman's doubts by proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same factors as \cite{schapire:freund:bartlett:lee1998} but is sharper than \cite{breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. by incorporating factors such as average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is heavily related to the whole margin distribution. we also provide margin distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite vc-dimension space.",Wei Gao,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.3613v5,2010-09-19T07:26:37Z,2013-08-28T03:03:18Z,cs.LG,"['cs.LG', '68Q01, 68Q32 68Txx']",2010,cs

1107.5661v1,On the Impact of Random Index-Partitioning on Index Compression,"the performance of processing search queries depends heavily on the stored index size. accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. roughly, index compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents, which strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of the inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. large commercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing web. the sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents among thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such that each server indexes only several millions pages. due to engineering and runtime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers is common. however, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely impacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of document ordering schemes. we study the impact of random index-partitioning on document ordering schemes. we show that index-partitioning decreases the aggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of servers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. on the other hand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the number of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as lexical url sorting and clustering with tsp, are applied. finally, we justify the common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we qualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it decreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of magnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.",M.

  Processes in Heterogeneous Materials","the prediction of thermo-mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous materials such as heat and moisture transport is strongly influenced by the uncertainty in parameters. such materials occur e.g. in historic buildings, and the durability assessment of these therefore needs a reliable and probabilistic simulation of transport processes, which is related to the suitable identification of material parameters. in order to include expert knowledge as well as experimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as bayesian inference. the classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in bayes's form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via computationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost impractical. in this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as the stochastic galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating procedure. the idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward simulation via the conventional finite element (fe) method by the evaluation of a polynomial chaos expansion (pce). such an approximation of the fe model for the forward simulation perfectly suits the bayesian updating. the presented uncertainty updating techniques are applied to the numerical model of coupled heat and moisture transport in heterogeneous materials with spatially varying coefficients defined by random fields.",A.

1104.0235v1,Gaussian Robust Classification,"supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge. specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data correctly. in order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. the later can is done usually by adding a regularization term. the statistical learning theory explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the complexity of the learned model. this explanation, however, is rather abstract and does not have a geometric intuition. the generalization error of a classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize well. indeed, xu et al. [2009] have shown that the svm formulation is equivalent to a robust optimization (ro) formulation, in which an adversary displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined radius. in this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing each data point with a gaussian cloud centered at the sample. loss is evaluated as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. this setup fits the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. we develop an ro framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the noise. in our algorithm named guru, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative considerations. our experiments show that this framework performs as well as svm and even slightly better in some cases. generalizations for mercer kernels and for the multiclass case are presented as well. we also show that our framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective functions.",Ido Ginodi,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.0235v1,2011-04-01T19:33:05Z,2011-04-01T19:33:05Z,cs.LG,['cs.LG'],2011,cs

1104.3489v3,Markov Decision Processes with Multiple Long-run Average Objectives,"we study markov decision processes (mdps) with multiple limit-average (or mean-payoff) functions. we consider two different objectives, namely, expectation and satisfaction objectives. given an mdp with k limit-average functions, in the expectation objective the goal is to maximize the expected limit-average value, and in the satisfaction objective the goal is to maximize the probability of runs such that the limit-average value stays above a given vector. we show that under the expectation objective, in contrast to the case of one limit-average function, both randomization and memory are necessary for strategies even for epsilon-approximation, and that finite-memory randomized strategies are sufficient for achieving pareto optimal values. under the satisfaction objective, in contrast to the case of one limit-average function, infinite memory is necessary for strategies achieving a specific value (i.e. randomized finite-memory strategies are not sufficient), whereas memoryless randomized strategies are sufficient for epsilon-approximation, for all epsilon>0. we further prove that the decision problems for both expectation and satisfaction objectives can be solved in polynomial time and the trade-off curve (pareto curve) can be epsilon-approximated in time polynomial in the size of the mdp and 1/epsilon, and exponential in the number of limit-average functions, for all epsilon>0. our analysis also reveals flaws in previous work for mdps with multiple mean-payoff functions under the expectation objective, corrects the flaws, and allows us to obtain improved results.",Tomáš Brázdil,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3489v3,2011-04-18T14:12:46Z,2014-02-12T23:21:13Z,cs.GT,['cs.GT'],2011,cs

math/0112100v1,Chebyshev's bias for composite numbers with restricted prime divisors,"let p(x,d,a) denote the number of primes p<=x with p=a(mod d). chebyshev's bias is the phenomenon that `more often' p(x;d,n)>p(x;d,r) than the other way around, where n is a quadratic non-residue mod d and r is a quadratic residue mod d. if p(x;d,n)>=p(x;d,r) for every x up to some large number, then one expects that n(x;d,n)>=n(x;d,r) for every x. here n(x;d,a) denotes the number of integers n<=x such that every prime divisor p of n satisfies p=a(mod d).   in this paper we develop some tools to deal with this type of problem and apply them to show that, for example, n(x;4,3)>=n(x;4,1) for every x. in the process we express the so called second order landau-ramanujan constant as an infinite series and show that the same type of formula holds true for a much larger class of constants.   in a sequel to this paper the methods developed here will be used and somewhat refined to resolve a conjecture from p. schmutz schaller to the extent that the hexagonal lattice is `better' than the square lattice (see p. 201 of bull. amer. math. soc. 35 (1998), 193-214).",Pieter Moree,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0112100v1,2001-12-11T11:26:00Z,2001-12-11T11:26:00Z,math.NT,"['math.NT', '11N37; 11Y60; 11N13']",2001,math

Nonlinear Enhancement,"we discuss a general framework for recovering edges in piecewise smooth functions with finitely many jump discontinuities, where $[f](x):=f(x+)-f(x-) \neq 0$. our approach is based on two main aspects--localization using appropriate concentration kernels and separation of scales by nonlinear enhancement.   to detect such edges, one employs concentration kernels, $k_\epsilon(\cdot)$, depending on the small scale $\epsilon$. it is shown that odd kernels, properly scaled, and admissible (in the sense of having small $w^{-1,\infty}$-moments of order ${\cal o}(\epsilon)$) satisfy $k_\epsilon*f(x) = [f](x) +{\cal o}(\epsilon)$, thus recovering both the location and amplitudes of all edges.as an example we consider general concentration kernels of the form $k^\sigma_n(t)=\sum\sigma(k/n)\sin kt$ to detect edges from the first $1/\epsilon=n$ spectral modes of piecewise smooth f's. here we improve in generality and simplicity over our previous study in [a. gelb and e. tadmor, appl. comput. harmon. anal., 7 (1999), pp. 101-135]. both periodic and nonperiodic spectral projections are considered. we identify, in particular, a new family of exponential factors, $\sigma^{exp}(\cdot)$, with superior localization properties.   the other aspect of our edge detection involves a nonlinear enhancement procedure which is based on separation of scales between the edges, where $k_\epsilon*f(x)\sim [f](x) \neq 0$, and the smooth regions where $k_\epsilon*f = {\cal o}(\epsilon) \sim 0$. numerical examples demonstrate that by coupling concentration kernels with nonlinear enhancement one arrives at effective edge detectors.",Anne Gelb,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0112016v1,2001-12-03T07:30:32Z,2001-12-03T07:30:32Z,math.NA,"['math.NA', '42A10; 42A50; 65T10']",2001,math

math/0404338v2,Topological properties of Hamiltonian circle actions,"this paper studies hamiltonian circle actions, i.e. circle subgroups of the group ham(m,\om) of hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold (m,\om). our main tool is the seidel representation of \pi_1(\ham(m,\om)) in the units of the quantum homology ring. we show that if the weights of the action at the points at which the moment map is a maximum are sufficiently small then the circle represents a nonzero element of \pi_1(\ham(m,\om)). further, if the isotropy has order at most two and the circle contracts in \ham(m,\om) then the homology of m is invariant under an involution. for example, the image of the normalized moment map is a symmetric interval [-a,a]. if the action is semifree (i.e. the isotropy weights are 0 or +/- 1) then we calculate the leading order term in the seidel representation, an important technical tool in understanding the quantum cohomology of manifolds that admit semifree hamiltonian circle actions. if the manifold is toric, we use our results about this representation to describe the basic multiplicative structure of the quantum cohomology ring of an arbitrary toric manifold. there are two important technical ingredients; one relates the equivariant cohomology of $m$ to the morse flow of the moment map, and the other is a version of the localization principle for calculating gromov--witten invariants on symplectic manifolds with s^1-actions.",Dusa McDuff,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404338v2,2004-04-19T15:57:53Z,2005-05-12T13:02:56Z,math.SG,"['math.SG', '53D20,53D45,57S05']",2004,math

  Models","we consider a class of semiparametric regression models which are one-parameter extensions of the cox [j. roy. statist. soc. ser. b 34 (1972) 187-220] model for right-censored univariate failure times. these models assume that the hazard given the covariates and a random frailty unique to each individual has the proportional hazards form multiplied by the frailty.   the frailty is assumed to have mean 1 within a known one-parameter family of distributions. inference is based on a nonparametric likelihood. the behavior of the likelihood maximizer is studied under general conditions where the fitted model may be misspecified. the joint estimator of the regression and frailty parameters as well as the baseline hazard is shown to be uniformly consistent for the pseudo-value maximizing the asymptotic limit of the likelihood. appropriately standardized, the estimator converges weakly to a gaussian process. when the model is correctly specified, the procedure is semiparametric efficient, achieving the semiparametric information bound for all parameter components. it is also proved that the bootstrap gives valid inferences for all parameters, even under misspecification.   we demonstrate analytically the importance of the robust inference in several examples. in a randomized clinical trial, a valid test of the treatment effect is possible when other prognostic factors and the frailty distribution are both misspecified. under certain conditions on the covariates, the ratios of the regression parameters are still identifiable. the practical utility of the procedure is illustrated on a non-hodgkin's lymphoma dataset.",Michael R.

  fractional time series","we consider a time series model involving a fractional stochastic component, whose integration order can lie in the stationary/invertible or nonstationary regions and be unknown, and an additive deterministic component consisting of a generalized polynomial. the model can thus incorporate competing descriptions of trending behavior. the stationary input to the stochastic component has parametric autocorrelation, but innovation with distribution of unknown form. the model is thus semiparametric, and we develop estimates of the parametric component which are asymptotically normal and achieve an m-estimation efficiency bound, equal to that found in work using an adaptive lam/lan approach. a major technical feature which we treat is the effect of truncating the autoregressive representation in order to form innovation proxies. this is relevant also when the innovation density is parameterized, and we provide a result for that case also. our semiparametric estimates employ nonparametric series estimation, which avoids some complications and conditions in kernel approaches featured in much work on adaptive estimation of time series models; our work thus also contributes to methods and theory for nonfractional time series models, such as autoregressive moving averages. a monte carlo study of finite sample performance of the semiparametric estimates is included.",P.

math/0503676v1,Bump hunting with non-Gaussian kernels,"it is well known that the number of modes of a kernel density estimator is monotone nonincreasing in the bandwidth if the kernel is a gaussian density. there is numerical evidence of nonmonotonicity in the case of some non-gaussian kernels, but little additional information is available. the present paper provides theoretical and numerical descriptions of the extent to which the number of modes is a nonmonotone function of bandwidth in the case of general compactly supported densities. our results address popular kernels used in practice, for example, the epanechnikov, biweight and triweight kernels, and show that in such cases nonmonotonicity is present with strictly positive probability for all sample sizes n\geq3. in the epanechnikov and biweight cases the probability of nonmonotonicity equals 1 for all n\geq2. nevertheless, in spite of the prevalence of lack of monotonicity revealed by these results, it is shown that the notion of a critical bandwidth (the smallest bandwidth above which the number of modes is guaranteed to be monotone) is still well defined. moreover, just as in the gaussian case, the critical bandwidth is of the same size as the bandwidth that minimises mean squared error of the density estimator. these theoretical results, and new numerical evidence, show that the main effects of nonmonotonicity occur for relatively small bandwidths, and have negligible impact on many aspects of bump hunting.",Peter Hall,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0503676v1,2005-03-29T12:00:53Z,2005-03-29T12:00:53Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62G07 (Primary) 62G20.

math/0508276v1,Boosting with early stopping: Convergence and consistency,"boosting is one of the most significant advances in machine learning for classification and regression. in its original and computationally flexible version, boosting seeks to minimize empirically a loss function in a greedy fashion. the resulting estimator takes an additive function form and is built iteratively by applying a base estimator (or learner) to updated samples depending on the previous iterations. an unusual regularization technique, early stopping, is employed based on cv or a test set. this paper studies numerical convergence, consistency and statistical rates of convergence of boosting with early stopping, when it is carried out over the linear span of a family of basis functions. for general loss functions, we prove the convergence of boosting's greedy optimization to the infinimum of the loss function over the linear span. using the numerical convergence result, we find early-stopping strategies under which boosting is shown to be consistent based on i.i.d. samples, and we obtain bounds on the rates of convergence for boosting estimators. simulation studies are also presented to illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results for providing insights to practical aspects of boosting. as a side product, these results also reveal the importance of restricting the greedy search step-sizes, as known in practice through the work of friedman and others. moreover, our results lead to a rigorous proof that for a linearly separable problem, adaboost with \epsilon\to0 step-size becomes an l^1-margin maximizer when left to run to convergence.",Tong Zhang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0508276v1,2005-08-16T08:22:24Z,2005-08-16T08:22:24Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62G05, 62G08 (Primary)']",2005,math

math/0507420v1,Generalizations of the Familywise Error Rate,"consider the problem of simultaneously testing null hypotheses h_1,...,h_s. the usual approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (fwer), the probability of even one false rejection. in many applications, particularly if s is large, one might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection provided the number of such cases is controlled, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to detect false null hypotheses. this suggests replacing control of the fwer by controlling the probability of k or more false rejections, which we call the k-fwer. we derive both single-step and stepdown procedures that control the k-fwer, without making any assumptions concerning the dependence structure of the p-values of the individual tests. in particular, we derive a stepdown procedure that is quite simple to apply, and prove that it cannot be improved without violation of control of the k-fwer. we also consider the false discovery proportion (fdp) defined by the number of false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). the false discovery rate proposed by benjamini and hochberg [j. roy. statist. soc. ser. b 57 (1995) 289-300] controls e(fdp). here, we construct methods such that, for any \gamma and \alpha, p{fdp>\gamma}\le\alpha. two stepdown methods are proposed. the first holds under mild conditions on the dependence structure of p-values, while the second is more conservative but holds without any dependence assumptions.",E.

math/0506081v3,"The Dantzig selector: Statistical estimation when $p$ is much larger
  than $n$","in many important statistical applications, the number of variables or parameters $p$ is much larger than the number of observations $n$. suppose then that we have observations $y=x\beta+z$, where $\beta\in\mathbf{r}^p$ is a parameter vector of interest, $x$ is a data matrix with possibly far fewer rows than columns, $n\ll p$, and the $z_i$'s are i.i.d. $n(0,\sigma^2)$. is it possible to estimate $\beta$ reliably based on the noisy data $y$? to estimate $\beta$, we introduce a new estimator--we call it the dantzig selector--which is a solution to the $\ell_1$-regularization problem \[\min_{\tilde{\b eta}\in\mathbf{r}^p}\|\tilde{\beta}\|_{\ell_1}\quad subject to\quad \|x^*r\|_{\ell_{\infty}}\leq(1+t^{-1})\sqrt{2\log p}\cdot\sigma,\] where $r$ is the residual vector $y-x\tilde{\beta}$ and $t$ is a positive scalar. we show that if $x$ obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns) and if the true parameter vector $\beta$ is sufficiently sparse (which here roughly guarantees that the model is identifiable), then with very large probability, \[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|_{\ell_2}^2\le c^2\cdot2\log p\cdot \biggl(\sigma^2+\sum_i\min(\beta_i^2,\sigma^2)\biggr).\] our results are nonasymptotic and we give values for the constant $c$. even though $n$ may be much smaller than $p$, our estimator achieves a loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean squared error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are nonzero, and which were above the noise level. in multivariate regression and from a model selection viewpoint, our result says that it is possible nearly to select the best subset of variables by solving a very simple convex program, which, in fact, can easily be recast as a convenient linear program (lp).",Emmanuel Candes,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0506081v3,2005-06-05T00:24:11Z,2008-03-21T10:25:34Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62C05, 62G05 (Primary) 94A08, 94A12 (Secondary)']",2005,math

  Samples, with Application to Cox Regression","weighted likelihood, in which one solves horvitz-thompson or inverse probability weighted (ipw) versions of the likelihood equations, offers a simple and robust method for fitting models to two phase stratified samples. we consider semiparametric models for which solution of infinite dimensional estimating equations leads to $\sqrt{n}$ consistent and asymptotically gaussian estimators of both euclidean and nonparametric parameters. if the phase two sample is selected via bernoulli (i.i.d.) sampling with known sampling probabilities, standard estimating equation theory shows that the influence function for the weighted likelihood estimator of the euclidean parameter is the ipw version of the ordinary influence function. by proving weak convergence of the ipw empirical process, and borrowing results on weighted bootstrap empirical processes, we derive a parallel asymptotic expansion for finite population stratified sampling. whereas the asymptotic variance for bernoulli sampling involves the within strata second moments of the influence function, for finite population stratified sampling it involves only the within strata variances. the latter asymptotic variance also arises when the observed sampling fractions are used as estimates of those known a priori. a general procedure is proposed for fitting semiparametric models with estimated weights to two phase data. several of our key results have already been derived for the special case of cox regression with stratified case-cohort studies, other complex survey designs and missing data problems more generally. this paper is intended to help place this previous work in appropriate context and to pave the way for applications to other models.",Norman E.

  applications","in this paper we construct high moment partial sum processes based on residuals of a garch model when the mean is known to be 0. we consider partial sums of $k$th powers of residuals, cusum processes and self-normalized partial sum processes. the $k$th power partial sum process converges to a brownian process plus a correction term, where the correction term depends on the $k$th moment $\mu_k$ of the innovation sequence. if $\mu_k=0$, then the correction term is 0 and, thus, the $k$th power partial sum process converges weakly to the same gaussian process as does the $k$th power partial sum of the i.i.d. innovations sequence. in particular, since $\mu_1=0$, this holds for the first moment partial sum process, but fails for the second moment partial sum process. we also consider the cusum and the self-normalized processes, that is, standardized by the residual sample variance. these behave as if the residuals were asymptotically i.i.d. we also study the joint distribution of the $k$th and $(k+1)$st self-normalized partial sum processes. applications to change-point problems and goodness-of-fit are considered, in particular, cusum statistics for testing garch model structure change and the jarque--bera omnibus statistic for testing normality of the unobservable innovation distribution of a garch model. the use of residuals for constructing a kernel density function estimation of the innovation distribution is discussed.",Reg Kulperger,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0602325v1,2006-02-15T10:54:26Z,2006-02-15T10:54:26Z,math.ST,"['math.ST', 'stat.TH', '60F17, 62M99, 62M10 (Primary)']",2006,math

0706.0246v3,Approximately bisimilar symbolic models for nonlinear control systems,"control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how physical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs. although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena, they are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the physical world. for this reason there is a growing interest in describing control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the continuous dynamics, where each ""symbol"" corresponds to an ""aggregate"" of states in the continuous model. since these symbolic models are of the same nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which software and hardware interact with the physical world. furthermore the use of symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. in this paper we show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. the approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic model and can be rendered as small as desired. furthermore if the state space of the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. for digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental input-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable quantization of the inputs.",Giordano Pola,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0246v3,2007-06-02T01:47:09Z,2008-01-14T04:24:38Z,math.OC,"['math.OC', '93A30']",2007,math

math/0702353v3,The Compact Discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) Method for Elliptic Problems,"we present a compact discontinuous galerkin (cdg) method for an elliptic model problem. the problem is first cast as a system of first order equations by introducing the gradient of the primal unknown, or flux, as an additional variable. a standard discontinuous galerkin (dg) method is then applied to the resulting system of equations. the numerical interelement fluxes are such that the equations for the additional variable can be eliminated at the element level, thus resulting in a global system that involves only the original unknown variable. the proposed method is closely related to the local discontinuous galerkin (ldg) method [b. cockburn and c.-w. shu, siam j. numer. anal., 35 (1998), pp. 2440-2463], but, unlike the ldg method, the sparsity pattern of the cdg method involves only nearest neighbors. also, unlike the ldg method, the cdg method works without stabilization for an arbitrary orientation of the element interfaces. the computation of the numerical interface fluxes for the cdg method is slightly more involved than for the ldg method, but this additional complication is clearly offset by increased compactness and flexibility. compared to the br2 [f. bassi and s. rebay, j. comput. phys., 131 (1997), pp. 267-279] and ip [j. douglas, jr., and t. dupont, in computing methods in applied sciences (second internat. sympos., versailles, 1975), lecture notes in phys. 58, springer, berlin, 1976, pp. 207-216] methods, which are known to be compact, the present method produces fewer nonzero elements in the matrix and is computationally more efficient.",Jaume Peraire,http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0702353v3,2007-02-13T03:50:25Z,2008-09-15T20:53:21Z,math.NA,"['math.NA', '65M60, 65M12, 65M15']",2007,math

0704.2929v2,La controverse de 1874 entre Camille Jordan et Leopold Kronecker,"during the whole of 1874, camille jordan and leopold kronecker quar- relled vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. that theory promised a ""general"" and ""homogeneous"" treatment of numerous questions arising in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems, stated independently by jordan and weierstrass, that would today be considered equivalent. it was, however, the perceived difference between those two theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. focusing on this quarrel allows us to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to linear algebra. the latter approaches identified these practices with methods for the classification of similar matrices. we show that the prac- tices -- jordan's canonical reduction and kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect identities inseparable from the social context of the time. moreover, these practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also -- in light of a long history tracing back to the work of lagrange, laplace, cau- chy, and hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra and arithmetic. by interrogating the cultural identities of such practices, this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.",Frederic Brechenmacher,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2929v2,2007-04-23T07:04:34Z,2011-11-03T14:28:41Z,math.HO,['math.HO'],2007,math
